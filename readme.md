            Educational first project.

    Cause my job is a dental technician,
     I decided to make a service for the work accounting.

    The task of the application is to record the works
(patient, clinic, type of product, quantity, photo*), 
manage and store them in monthly reports (by SQL in the database and create files .xls), 
and also count the salary.

    I am planning a project like Android application
 and server/backend(tomcat) with database (MySQL).
