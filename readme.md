            Educational pet-project.

    Cause my job is a dental technician,
     I decided to make a service for work accounting.

    The task of the application is to record 
     the works (patient, clinic, type of work, quantity, photo*),
     manage and store them in monthly reports (by MySQL), and also count the salary.

    I am planning a project like Android application,
     Windows desktop application (FX), a server part (backend) and a database (SQL).
